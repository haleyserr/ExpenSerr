## Project Summary

ExpenSerr is an Expense Report app that allows employees to submit expenses and route for Approval/Review. 

The primary roles are as follows:

Admin: Set up new accounts and user roles (employee, approver, accountant, etc)

Employee: Submit and track Expense Reports

Approver: Review Employee Expenses, Approve for reimbursement

Accountant: Review Approved Expenses, Post to ERP 

The magic is in the data. ExpenSerr aims to do more than just take a typically paper-intensive process into the web. ExpenSerr will handle Expense Reports from Travel Start to Check Cut.

ExpenSerr is setup with a mock ERP database (inspiration taken from BOLO) to help populate Cost Centers, GL Account Codes, and more. This ensures that Expense Reports are not submitted with any errors and provides a more pleasant employee experience (no guessing a Cost Center).

Following Accounting Review, ExpenSerr will create an import file (essentially a JE template) which includes the Expense Header and all associated line item detail. This txt file can be sent to your ERP for automatic upload, no need to retype the expense information!
